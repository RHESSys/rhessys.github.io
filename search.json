    "text": "Location: Virtual\nDate: 1-2 May 2024\nRegistration Cost: FREE\nAbstract Deadline: Closed\nRegister for Conference\nAfter registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.\nFinal Schedule\n\nRHESSys Conference 2024 seeks to bring together members of the RHESSys community to share, learn, and network with one another. The conference will be held virtually on 1-2 May 2024. We welcome presentations on all topics related to RHESSys, including water cycling, carbon cycling, nutrient cycling, and/or fire, in both natural and urban environments. We are also interested in demonstrations of new model functionality.\nWe expect to have talks in two formats (regular and lighting) and a roundtable discussion. The regular talks will be an opportunity to describe projects conducted with RHESSys or new technical features. The lighting slots are perfect for those just starting out with RHESSys. No results needed! Just tell us how you are applying or thinking about applying the model.\nWe encourage you to start thinking about an abstract. The conference will be an excellent opportunity to highlight your work with fellow RHESSys modelers.\nFinally, since this is the first year that we are holding a RHESSys conference, please help us spread the word. Feel free to pass this distribution to anyone who might be interested.\nWe hope to see you in May!\nCheers, Ryan, Ojas, Sloane, and Roy\nRyan Bart | UC Merced\nOjas Sarup | UC Santa Barbara\nSloane Stephenson | UC Santa Barbara\nRuoyu Zhang | University of Virginia\nFor conference inquiries or to get on the RHESSys email list, please email Ryan Bart: rbart3 [@] ucmerced.edu.\n\n\n\nQuestions about Conference\nWhat time will the conference be held?\nAlthough the exact times won’t be established until the schedule is made, the approximate times will be as follows:\n- West Coast USA: Morning to early afternoon\n- East Coast USA: Late morning to late afternoon\n- Europe: Evening\n- East Asia and Australia: Middle of night (sorry!)"

    "text": "How do I get RHESSys?\nRHESSys can be downloaded from GitHub. The standard version of the model is available for Linux and MacOS. Windows users will generally need to install Linux on their PCs. Once downloaded, the standard version of RHESSys requires compiling in order to operate. RHESSys is also available via a Docker, which allows installation without compiling. Please refer to the RHESSys Wiki for full details on how to obtain the standard or Docker versions of RHESSys.\nThe most recent release of RHESSys is Version 7.4, which is recommended for all new users. Version releases are made periodally from trunk, which is the most stable branch of RHESSys. If more advanced features are desired, the develop branch is used for development and contains the most recent updates."

    "text": "Welcome to the online home for RHESSys, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System. RHESSys is a distributed physically-based model designed to simulate daily water, carbon, energy, and nutrient fluxes at the watershed scale. RHESSys combines the functionality of a hydrological model and an ecological model. Thus, RHESSys is able to represent how water moves through a watershed, from upland areas to riparian zones and the stream via surface topography, subsurface pathways, and groundwater. Vegetation is also simulated in the model, growing by gaining carbon via photosynthesis, but also losing carbon via respiration, turnover, and mortality. Vegetation processes in the model are mediated by water, energy, and nutrient availability. At the same time, water and nutrient availability to streamflow is mediated by vegetation.\nThis feedback loop between water and vegetation within RHESSys is what makes the model unique. It separates RHESSys from a typical distributed hydrology model, which has vegetation on a landscape, but that vegetation doesn’t grow. It is also separates RHESSys from most ecological models, which often simulate subsurface processes for the vegetation growth, but cannot capture water redistribution along hillslopes or output to a stream. The coupling allows users to explore novel questions about environmental system behavior."
